Gamified Learning Platform for Rural Education

Description

Build a gamified digital platform to enhance learning outcomes for students in rural schools (grades 6-12), focusing on STEM subjects. The platform should use interactive games, multilingual content, and offline access to engage students with limited internet connectivity.

Expected Outcome

A mobile app or web platform increasing student engagement by 15%, with analytics for teachers to track progress, deployable on low-cost devices.

Technical Feasibility

Uses HTML5/CSS for offline-compatible web apps, integrated with open-source gamification frameworks and localized content delivery.
